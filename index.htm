About me
<i class="fa-solid fa-fish"></i>
</h3>
</div>

<p>I have always had an interest in both technology and wildlife. I have been lucky enough to spend time studying
both of these interests through my FdSc in Wildlife Education and Media and most recently, full stack
development. When it comes to wildlife, my passion lies in the marine world and anything relating to it.
Growing up in cornwall I am surrounded by the ocean and, with the help of my dad, I was able to fully explore that
passion through swimming, diving, fishing, and rockpooling.</p>

<div class="subh" id="hc">
<h3>HTML and CSS
<i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>
</h3>
</div>

<p>I am using two different files to create this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first is for HTML
<ul><li>This is the file where I add the content of the website.</li></ul> 
</li>
<li>The second is for CSS</li>
<ul><li>This is where I style my website</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>I have my CSS file linked to my HTML file using the "link" element. This allows me to keep my styling seperate
from the rest of my code.</p>

<br>

<div class="subh">
<h3>Page Features
<i class="fa-solid fa-brush"></i>
</h3>
</div>

<br>


<p>I am using "div" and "class" to define which sections of the page are styled in certain ways. As oppose to
styling each element the same way this allows me to have them styled by groups instead.
</p>
<p>I am also using icons on the headings which I have implemented using the 'i class' element. This allows me to 
have a visual representation of the contents included in each section.
</p>
<p>I have also implemented a list and a table, both of which are skills I learned on my course. These can be seen 
in the "HTML and CSS" section, and in the section titled "What are my goals for 2025?. </p>
<p>At the top of the page I have added a section that links to different parts of the portfolio to help make it 
easier to get to where you want to go. As more content is added to the page, those links wwill become more and more
useful.</p>
<p>A datalist form has been added to the bottom of the page which is one of the challenges I had to complete for my
    course, I have also added a border around it to specify that it is something I completed on that. When the form is
    repurposed I will most likely remove the border and use it somewhere else.</p>

<br>

<div class="subh" id="so far">
<a href="Progress.html" target="_blank">
    <h3>What have I done so far?
<i class="fa-solid fa-folder-open"></i>
</h3>
</a>
</div>

<p>So far I have completed the 5 stage coding challenge which helped secure me a place on a full stack development
course and created this portfolio. I hope that as I learn more skills I will be able to keep changing and updating 
this page to better
represent my skillset.
</p>
<p>I am nearing the end of the HTML section of my course and will soon be moving onto CSS. This will help me
    tremendously when it comes to styling my website as all of the CSS I have used on this page is what I learned on
    the 5 stage coding challenge.
</p>
<p>I also would like to reincomperate the image and form I have on this page to make them more specific to me and the
    page. Eventually the form will have a much more practical use and the image could relate to some photography work
    I have done in the past. This would be where seperate pages could be useful as I could have a page dedicated to
    my photography which will demonstrate not only my photography/editing skills but my coding skills too.</p>
